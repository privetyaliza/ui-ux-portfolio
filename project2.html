      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This redesign was completed as part of the course <em>HTI.241 User Interface Design: Principles, Methods, and Tools</em> course in a team of 5: me, Lotta Törnblom, Meisi Jalasjoki, Emmi Nikkilä and Ekaterina Vasileva. We chose to redesign the <a href="https://www.tuni.fi/sportuni/omasivu/?page=myevents;lang=en">MyPage of SportUni</a>, the sports and wellbeing service of Tampere University and TAMK, because we found it close to our common interest as students and immediately had some ideas for improvement. Our main goal was to improve the visual design of the service and make it more youthful and fun. We also aimed to fix some usability issues such as long scrolling screens and confusing tab naming.

      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <p>
        As user research was not the focus of the course, we started with creating imaginary users and their user needs, which basically meant asking ourselves: what we would expect from a service like this? After deciding on thescope of our work, we proceeded to create wireframes.
      <p>
        The identified user needs helped us make decisions on the structure and layout of the service and create the first wireframes.

      </figure>
      <p>
        The next important step was creating the design system. We looked at Tampere University's design guidelines and chose its secondary colors as our main ones. We also generated some illustrations to make the website more playful.

      </figure>
      <p>
        Finally, using the design system and the user needs we have identified, we created the screens for the prototype and the interactions between them.
