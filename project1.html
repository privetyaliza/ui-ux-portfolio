      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        UniWaste was created as part of the <em>HTI.110 User Interfaces and Human-Centered Design</em> course, where the task was to design a web service that encourages sustainable behavior among university students. The primary goal of the service is to reduce food waste in campus restaurants by offering a platform for redistributing leftover food to students at the end of the working day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project addressed the issue of food waste caused by unpurchased food being simply thrown away. Inspired by services like <a href="https://www.resq-club.com/">ResQ</a>, we adapted the concept for student restaurants. I worked on this project with Katariina Kariniemi and Aappeli Riuttala.

      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <p>
        For the user research phase, my team to developed interview questions aimed at understanding student perspectives on food waste. I conducted 2 user interviews, which contributed to the creation of a user persona that represented our target audience. thematic coding was the main tool for data analysis. After it was completed, main user needs were identified which gave us the direction for the design of the service.

      <p>
        The identified user needs helped us make decisions on the structure and layout of the service and create the first wireframes.

      <p>
        For the visual design, we decided to base the style on the <a href="https://unisafka.fi/">Unisafka</a> (campus restaurant menu aggregator) website and chose green as the primary color to emphasize sustainability. Simplicity and minimalism were prioritized in the design, reflecting user feedback from the research phase.

      <h2>My contribution</h2>
      <p>
        In this project, I was responsible for designing the individual item page and its pop-up windows, and the desktop version of the service. While I worked closely with my team members on all aspects of the project, these areas were my primary focus.
