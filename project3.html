      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        BudgetBuddy is a mobile application designed to help students manage their personal finances effectively. It was created as part of a project for the <em>SDL.520 Principles of Service Design</em>, and the task was to use 5 different service design methods. The app aims to simplify budget tracking, promote financial literacy, and encourage better spending habits among students. My teammates for this course were Ludwika Pilch, Kashaf Tariq, Katariina Kariniemi, Manal Nizamani, and Victoria Kr√∂ger.

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        The design process began with user research to understand the financial management habits of students. I have conducted one online interview with a target user group representative. After each of the group members was done with their interviews, we proceeded to the data analysis. The main tool we used for it was affinity diagramming.

      <p>
        Insights from the research were used to create personas and define user needs. Next, we focused on creating the information architecture for BudgetBuddy.

        Finally, wireframes and prototypes were developed iteratively.

      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        I have participated in all of the service design methods we have used, but I would say that my most important contributions were in creating the user interview questions and the information architecture.
